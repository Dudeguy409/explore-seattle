  I am not a big fan of museums, especially during a vacation. That being said, I enjoyed seeing the following museums because
  they offer something unique and emphasize the particular history or culture of Seattle.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Burke Museum at UW: Native American Northwest Coast Art </li>
  <li>Seattle Art Museum</li>
  <li>Pinball Museum</li>
  <li>Living Computer Museum</li>
  <li>Museum of Flight</li>
  <li>Nordic Museum</li>
</ul>
