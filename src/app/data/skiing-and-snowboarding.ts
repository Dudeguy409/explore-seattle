It is best known for having easy slopes for beginners, but in reality, it has a decent mix of slopes for all skill levels.  The biggest downside to Snoqualmie is that the resort is more or less geographically separated into five different slopes.  Traveling between the main two slopes involves taking a short shuttle or skiing down a black diamond."],
