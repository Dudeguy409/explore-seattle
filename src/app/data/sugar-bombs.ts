Its gay roots are still apparent, though; its signature drink is Unicorn Jizz, but that's just the tip of the iceburg of an incredibly sweet drink menu.  Also, the walls are painted in vibrant, neon colors reminiscent of The Beatles' Yellow Submarine movie.  To top it off, Unicorn also has a small but decent barcade."]
