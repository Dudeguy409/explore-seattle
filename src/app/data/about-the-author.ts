    description: ["Hi!  I'm Andrew Davidson.  I am a Software Engineer originally from Saint Louis.  I moved to Seattle in September of 2016 after graduating from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana.  I moved here to work at Google as part of their year-long Engineering Residency Program.  I can definitively say that Seattle is far more interesting than Terre Haute, Indiana.  Since moving here, I have seized the opportunity to explore the city and the surrounding areas as much as time will reasonably allow.  I have done this in hopes of filling the hole in my heart that formed after living in corn fields for four years.  I created this website to help others who wish to do the same.  I also used this as an opportunity to work with new Web Design technologies and have visible work to show potential employers.  I developed this web app independently with copious amounts of feedback from friends."],
