A bike and pedestrian path runs along the Puget Sound for a quite distance and has great views of Downtown Seattle and the Olympic Peninsula.  The last half mile of the waterfront trail runs along a beach park on one side and a popular strip of restaurants and shops on the other.  The lighthouse lies an additional 5 to 10 minutes west by foot.  Lincoln Park lies another 15 minutes south by Car.  It is small, but has a nice waterfront trail, some cool driftwood, a nice overlook, and a pleasant forested area.  Keep in mind that Admiral Point is a nice overlook that may be worth stopping by on your way to or from Downtown Seattle."]

The park alone is a bit over-rated in my opinion, but you can rent a kayak or boat to explore the lake.  The park is also attached to the Seattle Zoo.  The park is located 10 or 15 minutes north of Downtown Seattle."]

The Locks were constructed in Ballard (10 minutes north of Downtown) as part of this project in order to maintain the water level of Lake Washington and prevent seawater from mixing in with it.  If you are lucky, you may get to watch a ship pass through!  Additionally, you can watch Salmon migrate through the locks.  The peak migration time is between July and August."]
