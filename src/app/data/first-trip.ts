Ask around at local shops for gum and directions if you need them.  The market extends several levels deeper than some may realize.  The market also has nice views of the bay.  It closes absurdly early, even on weekends and holidays; things start dying down around 4:30 or 5."]

        "xxx rootbear, twin peaks.  I highly recommend a day trip to see the Cascades.  I don't mean this as a substitute for the trip to the coast beacuse they each have a their own unique vibe.  I promise that I am not just saying that to sound like a hipster.  Specifically, I recommend a trip to the Cascades for two reasons: <b>Snoqualmie Falls</b> and a <b>hike</b> through an evergreen forest.",
        "<b>Snoqualmie Falls</b> offers a stunning view.  The viewpoint is accessible direcly by car and is decently close to the highway.  While it feels a world away from the city, it is in fact only 35 minutes away.  It is accessible year-round.",
        "In addition to Snoqualmie Falls (not instead of), I recommend a hike through an evergreen forest in the Cascades.",
        "If you are visiting between mid-April and mid-November, I recommend the hike to <b>Franklin Falls</b>.  It is significantly smaller than Snoqualmie Falls, but you can walk directly up to the waterfall.  The other advantage is that it's an easy hike.  The trail takes less than an hour each way and is probably the flattest hiking trail you'll find in the cascades.  The trailhead is 1 hour away from Seattle by car, so it's a bit further than Snoqualmie Falls.  Although Seattle itself doesn't get too cold or get much snow in the winter, the trail is at a pretty high altitude.  It is closed for a decent portion of the year.",
        "If you are visiting during the colder months, I recommend hiking to <b>Poo Poo Point</b> instead.  It has the same ambience of any other hike in the Cascades, but it is almost never snowed out because of its lower altitude.  It is only 25 minutes from Downtown Seattle and the trail only takes an hour each way.  It's a pretty short hike, even if it does <em>feel</em> like forever.  The view at the top is great and the thick evergreen forest is beautiful."
