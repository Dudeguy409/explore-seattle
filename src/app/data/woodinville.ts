        "Woodinville is a cute valley of farmland nestled northeast of Seattle.  It is home to an astonishing number of wineries and wine tasting rooms.  As the map linked below demonstrates, there are over 100 wineries and 50 tasting rooms.  If that isn't enough for you, you need to seek professional help!",
        "A wine tasting involves sampling 4 to 8 different wines for a tasting fee of $10 to $15.  This fee is waived if you buy a bottle of wine (which is often about the same price as the tasting).",
        "Wine tasting is popular year-round, but the tasting rooms open later and close earlier than expected: 10 Am to 5 PM is typical.",
        "The biggest problem with Woodinville is transportation.  Although the drive only takes 20 to 30 minutes, drinking and driving don't mix.  That being said, I still still recommend driving.  Unfortunately, Uber and Lyft are be prohibitively expensive: about $40 each way. Taking a bus to Woodinville is complicated because there is only one route: the 522 bus.  You <em>have</em> to get on in the heart of downtown and it takes 50 minutes, and then it's another 20 minute walk or a short, affordable taxi ride.  If you want to drive but don't want to have a designated driver, I recommend pacing yourself and/or drinking in moderation, and then having a long meal at a nearby restaurant before you drive back.  In any case, relax, enjoy your time in Woodinville, and don't rush it.",
        "On a similar note, you may be wondering, 'How do I travel between the different wine tasting rooms?'  Well, as you can gather from the map, there are several hubs where you can easily walk between tasting rooms.  If you took the bus, you'll probably want to get a taxi to one of these hubs.  However, if you want to visit specific wine tasting rooms, you may need a car.",
        "To be clear, the outstanding majority of the grapes are actually grown in Eastern Washington or Oregon; the tasting rooms are more of a convenience."],
