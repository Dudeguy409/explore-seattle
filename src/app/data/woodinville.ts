            description: ["Woodinville is a cute valley of farmland nestled a convenient 20 to 30 minute drive northeast of Seattle.  It is home to an astonishing number of wineries and wine tasting rooms.  You are welcome to try to plan an itinerary, but as the map below demonstrates, there are over 100 wineries and 50 tasting rooms.  That being said, the map actually leaves out quite a few wine tasting rooms, but if that wasn't enough for you, you need to seek professional help.  With so many choices, picking two or three always feels impossible; I just show up and explore my options on foot.","Wine tasting is popular year-round, but the tasting rooms open later and close earlier than expected: 10 Am to 5 PM is typical.","A wine tasting involves a sampling of between 4 and 8 different wines for a tasting fee of between $5 and $15.  If you buy a bottle at the end (which is often about the same price as the tasting), the tasting fee is waived.", "To be clear, the outstanding majority of the grapes are actually grown in Eastern Washington or Oregon; the tasting rooms are more of a convenience."],
