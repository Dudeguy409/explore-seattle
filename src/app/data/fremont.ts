It is home to a few interesting attractions like the world's busiest drawbridge and a giant troll statue.","That being said, I imagine that for most visitors, Fremont might not be interesting enough to be worth seeing just for that.  Fortunately, Fremont is close to Gasworks Park, has a year-round Sunday Market, and has lots of restaurants, bars, and quirky boutique shops."],

It might be a bit controversial for me to recommend walking across it because it's noisy and not particularly popular.  Despite this, I found that it had some of the best views in Seattle.  It is one of only a few places in Seattle where you can see both <em>The Olympics</em> and <em>The Cascades</em> (a distance of at least 82 miles) on a clear day.  Did I mention that it's <em>free?</em>"]
