            description: ["The waters of Lake Union offer a spectacular view of the city and are fun to explore by Kayak or Paddleboard.  I highly recommend this as one of the most fun activities I've done in Seattle.  Bear in mind that choppy waves caused by strong winds can make kayaking a bit miserable though.  I prefer the closed kayaks of Northwest Outdoor Center to the open kayaks of Moss Bay.  That being said, kayaking is popular during the summer months, and it's not unusual that one or both locations will be booked out for the day.  Try to make an advance reservation, or make do with what you have; an open kayak is better than no kayak."],

            description: ["Puget Sound boasts an impressive network of Car Ferries that help break up the monotony of a long drive to and from a hike on the Olympic Peninsula or at Deception Pass.  The view is great, too! That being said, the most scenic and most popular is probably the route between Downtown Seattle and Bainbridge Island.  There are quite a few beautiful parks on Bainbridge Island to explore, but you'll need a car.  Without a car, you can explore the cute historic downtown area or go to a few wine tasting rooms."]

            description: ["During the warmer half of the year, you can explore Puget Sound by sailboat. Most expedition operators offer both a cheaper, shorter day trip and a longer, more expensive sunset expedition.  Because you share the sailboat with other people, it ends up being reasonably affordable."],

            title: "Fishing Charters",
            description: ["Fishing charters offer the opportunity to fish for Salmon, Halibut, Lingcod, Rockfish, Flounder, and sometimes Dungeness Crabs.  Different things are in season at different times.  There are an extremely limited number of Halibut fishing permits given out each year, in combination with a very short legal fishing season.  Same for Salmon, but to a lesser extent.  If you are planning to fish for Halibut or Salmon, confirm your plans months in advance if possible.  If you are crazy about fishing, but don't want to shell out (no pun intended) the money, you <em>could</em> go crabbing off the pier next to Golden Gardens.  The gear is pretty cheap and the process is relative straigforward."],
