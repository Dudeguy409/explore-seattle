    description: ["The Cascade Mountains are located east of Seattle.  During the winter, hiking trails at higher altitudes become buried in snow, making hiking infeasible.  The good news is that there are a few hikes at lower altitudes that have pretty much the same ambience and are only closed for a couple of weeks a year.  Lake 22 and The Ice Caves Poo Poo Point Kamikaze Falls Snow Lake Mount Si Franklin Falls Snoqualmie Falls is a giant waterfall that is immediately accisbly by road, and is pretty close to I90.  It is NOT a hike, really.  On your way back from your hike, consider stopping by a historic resturant: XXX Rootbeer Drive-In, Twin Peaks Diner"]
