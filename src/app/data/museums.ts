That being said, there are a handful of museums in Seattle that offer something unique to visitors because they showcase the particular history or culture of Seattle.

            description: ["Located on University of Washington's campus, The Burke Museum is best known for its collection on Native American Northwest Coast Art.  This makes it a particularly unique and appealing museum to Seattle visitors, in my opinion.  The museum <em>does</em> have <em>other</em> exhbits on Natural History, but the Native American art is what stands out in my opinion.  Keep in mind that the museum is small and somewhat expensive for what it is, at $10 for adults. The good news is that,like the Seattle Art Museum, admission is free on the first Thursday of every month."]

            description: ["The Seattle Art Museum is located in the heart of Downtown, right next to Pike Place Market.  It is like most other art museums.  To me, its unique draw is in its Native American Northwest Coast Art collection, and perhaps its Japanese,Korean, and Chinese art collections.  Keep in mind that all of these exhibits are fairly small and that admisssion is rather expensive, at $25 for adults.  The good news is that on the first Thursday of every month (and first Friday for seniors), the regular museum is free.  Additional Special Exhibits are half off, too!  Also keep in mind that every Thursday (not just the first), the museum is open until 9 instead of 5.  It is closed Monday and Tuesday."]

The museum of Flight is located 20 to 30 minutes south of Downtown Seattle by car.  It is enormous, with huge sections both indoors as well as outdoors under a canopy.  For visitors who have been to another air and space museum before, it may not have anything too unique to offer, but for visitors who haven't, it would certainly make for an amazing first air and space museum visit!"]

It has a range of interesting exhibits.  It has a bunch of zainy, brainy, <em>physical</em> games, like writing simple programs for robots.  It also has a lot of old school <em>virtual</em> games like Oregon Trail and Donkey Kong on old computers and video game consoles. They also have a lot of nostalgic, historic computers lying around.  Overall, it is far more interesting than what you would expect when you hear 'computer museum'.  Admission is $16 per person."]
