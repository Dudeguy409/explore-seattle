There are hudreds of hiking trails within a couple of hours of Seattle, but they can be divided geographically based on which mountain range they belong to: The Olympics or the Cascades.  Deception pass is a notable exception that doesn't belong to either."],

The good news is that there are a few hikes at lower altitudes that have pretty much the same ambience and are only closed for a couple of weeks a year.  Lake 22 and The Ice Caves Poo Poo Point Kamikaze Falls Snow Lake Mount Si Franklin Falls Snoqualmie Falls is a giant waterfall that is immediately accisbly by road, and is pretty close to I90.  It is NOT a hike, really.  On your way back from your hike, consider stopping by a historic resturant: XXX Rootbeer Drive-In, Twin Peaks Diner"]
